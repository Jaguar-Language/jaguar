# Jaguar Lang

This repo is for the new open source Jaguar Language.   
Jaguar is a fast templating engine for generating PHP And/Or HTML.    
Jaguar can be implemented and extended easily as well, in order to suit your needs. This is explained in the **Expanding Jaguar** section.   

Jaguar comes implemented with a few handy modules as well, for example compiling inline styles written in SCSS. These modules can be found in the   
[Modules](src/modules) folder. These extensions should also be a good learning platform for extending Jaguar to your needs, as everything is injected as a module.
