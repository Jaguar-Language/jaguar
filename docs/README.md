## Jaguar Templating Language

> A fast templating language, to make writing PHP and/or Html faster.

## What is it

Jaguar is a templating language that is based on [Laravel's Blade](https://laravel.com/docs/5.6/blade) and [HAML](http://haml.info/). Jaguar was created to make writing PHP and HTML files quickly, by cutting down the amount of code you need to write in order to create a functioning file. Jaguar was also created with customisability in mind, allowing the end user to modify Jaguar to their needs.

Jaguar is similar to Blade in that all Jaguar files are compiled to pure PHP. The output directory can be specified when compiling, this is explained later on.

See the [Quick start](quickstart.md) for more details.
